[Kaggle: Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist/data)
Summary:

● Implemented a CNN-based sign language recognition model. This is an image recognition task.
● Improve the versatility and accuracy of the model through data enhancement (noise, segmentation, rotation, etc.), optimization of network architecture and number of layers, adjustment of learning rate, use of different optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam), early stop parameter optimization, etc. Rate.
● Use parallel computing libraries such as joblib to speed up model hyperparameter optimization.
● In addition to test accuracy, indicators such as confusion matrix, precison, and recall are also used for evaluation.
● Compared with other models (based on LR, random forest, AdaBoost, Xgboost, etc.), this model has great improvement.
